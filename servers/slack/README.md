## 🔍 About

This server is part of the OpenAPI Tools Collection. It provides a comprehensive interface to Slack workspace operations, including:

- 📋 List channels with message history
- 📤 Post messages and replies
- 👥 User information and profiles
- 👋 Add reactions to messages
- 📜 View message threads and history

All functionality is wrapped in a developer-friendly OpenAPI interface, making it perfect for integration with AI agents, automation tools, or custom Slack applications.

## 🔑 Prerequisites

Most of this is pulled straight from the Slack Python SDK so the barebones readme can easily be supplemented by reading the official docs. To set up, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Slack Bot Token**: Create a Slack App and get a Bot User OAuth Token
   - Visit [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
   - Create a new app or select existing
   - Add necessary bot scopes:
     - `channels:history`
     - `channels:read`
     - `chat:write`
     - `reactions:write`
     - `users:read`
     - `users:read.email`
   - Install the app to your workspace
   - You'll get the bot token on the last screen. 
2. **Team ID**: Your Slack workspace/team ID
   - Found in workspace settings or URL (go to your slack instance via web and it'll be after the slash)
3. **Channel IDs** (Optional):
   - Restrict the server to specific channels
   - Comma-separated list of channel IDs
4. **Server API Key** (`SERVER_API_KEY`, Optional):
   - If you set this environment variable to a secret value (e.g., a strong random string), the server will require this key to be passed in the `X-API-Key` HTTP header for all incoming requests.
   - This provides a layer of authentication to protect your server endpoint.
   - If left unset, the server will accept requests without API key authentication (less secure).

## 🌐 API Documentation

Once running, explore the interactive API documentation:

🖥️ Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs  
📄 OpenAPI JSON: http://localhost:8000/openapi.json  

The documentation includes detailed schemas, example requests, and response formats for all available tools.

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Keep your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` secure
- Use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- Consider implementing additional authentication for the API server in production. Setting the `SERVER_API_KEY` environment variable is the recommended way to add basic authentication.
- If `SERVER_API_KEY` is set, ensure clients send the correct key in the `X-API-Key` header.
- Review Slack's [security best practices](https://api.slack.com/authentication/best-practices)
